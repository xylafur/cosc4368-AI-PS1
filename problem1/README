I'm not sure why you're running this code because we weren't actually required
to write any for this problem.  But if you are running it, here are the
instructions on how to do so (they are the same as those for problem 4):

You need both rust and cargo to actually run this code.

If you are actually going to run this code, here is how to install rust and
cargo on redhat (because thats what all the UH servers are and I assume what
you'll be using) (you will obviously need super user permissions):

# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-devtools-rpms
# yum install rust-toolset-7


Then after rust is installed, run `cargo run` to run the program
