a) Algorithm A* does not terminate until a goal node is selected for expansion.
   However, a path to a goal node might be reached long before that node is
   selected for expansion1. Why not terminating as soon as the goal node is
   found? Illustrate your answer with an example!


    Even though a goal node is found, there is still the possiblity that there
    is a better path to another goal node or even that same goal node.  Since
    the heuristic will underestimate the cost of a particular node to the goal
    node, some nodes may significantly underestimate the cost to the goal state
    causing them to be expanded sooner, even though they don't actually contain
    the best path.

    In the attached picture, we will expand nodes in this order:
        expanded node   |       open list
        S               |       [(A, 10), (B, 12)]
        A               |       [(C, 11), (B, 12)]
        C               |       [(B, 12), (G (from A), 13)]
        B               |       [(D, 9), (G (from A), 13)]
        D               |       [(G (from D), 10), (G (from A), 13)]
        G (from D)      |



b) A* is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution in the case that the
   function h(s) overestimates the true cost from getting from s to a goal
   state. Give a state space2 (describe it similarly to the seach space in
   problem 2) including a single initial state S and a single goal state G for
   which A* will not find the optimal solution; indicate the solution

    In the Depicted graph, the solution that would be founded by A* is not the
    optimal solution.

    A* will expand nodes in this order
        Expanded: S, A, C, D, F, G1

    resulting in the following solution:
        S -> A -> D -> G1

    This solution has a cost of
        3 + 6 + 6 = 15

    However, the actual optimal solution for this graph is:
        S -> B -> E -> H -> G2

    This solution has a cost of:
        7 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

    The reason that this solution is not chosen is because B over estimates the
    cost to a goal state.  In reality, the minimum distance from B to the goal
    G2 is only 3 away, it overestimates by a significant amount and is not
    chosen as the solution by A* as a result!
