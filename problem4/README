You need both rust and cargo to actually run this code.

If you are actually going to run this code, here is how to install rust and
cargo on redhat (because thats what all the UH servers are and I assume what
you'll be using) (you will obviously need super user permissions):

# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-devtools-rpms
# yum install rust-toolset-7


Then after rust is installed, run `cargo run` to run the program
